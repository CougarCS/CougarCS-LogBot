# Commands

To call any particular command, you need to begin with the prefix. By default, the prefix is set to `$`. For example, you can call the `help` command like so:

> $help

✅

## The `help` command.

When calling the `help` command without arguments, it will print an up-to-date list of commands.

> $help

✅

When calling the `help` command with a command name, it will print the info for that command.

> $help cancel

✅

You can ask the `help` command to print its own info!

> $help help

✅

If you ask the `help` command to print the details of a command that doesn't exist, it will error.

> $help foobar

⚠️

## The `stats` command.

The `stats` command will print your hours and outreach count since the launch of the bot.

> $stats

✅

The `stats` command will ignore all arguments.

> $stats 123

✅

> $stats abc

✅

The `stats` command does not work if the `lock` command has been called.

> $lock

✅

> $stats

⚠️

## The `cancel` command.

The `cancel` command requires an argument.

> $cancel

⚠️

The argument must be a confirmation number (check your confirmation receipt).

> $cancel abc123

⚠️

You can use the `cancel` command to cancel your log request.

> $cancel 5f7a257cbfc4ed66e5c321e4

✅

The `cancel` command will _only_ work on _your_ log request. For example, the confirmation number used here belongs to someone else.

> $cancel 5f78de2cbfc4ed66e5c321e2

⚠️

If you're a superuser, you can cancel _anyone's_ request. Here's the same example, except now you're a superuser.

> $cancel 5f78de2cbfc4ed66e5c321e2

✅

Once a log request is cancelled, it no longer exists. Attempting to cancel it again will not work.

> $cancel 5f78de2cbfc4ed66e5c321e2

⚠️

The `cancel` command uses the first argument and ignores the rest.

> $cancel 5f78de2cbfc4ed66e5c321e2 foobar abc123

✅

The `cancel` command does not work if the `lock` command has been called.

> $lock

✅

> $cancel 5f78dd28bfc4ed66e5c321df

⚠️

## The `credits` command.

The `credits` command ignores all arguments.

> $credits foo 123

✅

The `version` command ignores all arguments.

> $version foo 123

✅

The `version` command will print the current version of the bot.

> $version

✅

> $config

✅

The `config` command is _not_ affected by `lock` and `unlock` commands.

✅

## The `?` command.

The `?` command is special, since it stands alone without prefix and without arguments.

> ?

✅

> $?

⚠️

> ? foo 123

⚠️

NOTE: This command will send you a direct message with instructions on how to log your hours.

The `?` command is not effected by the `$lock` and `$unlock` commands.

> $lock

✅

> ?

✅

NOTE: The `?` command will not be listed by the `$help` command.

> $tiprate foobar

⚠️

> $tiprate 3

⚠️

> $tiprate -0.15

⚠️

The argument is rounded to 3 decimal places. This example is rounded to 0.255:

> $tiprate 0.2549925

✅

The `tiprate` command changes the chance that a pro tip will spawn. This example changes the chances to 15%:

> $tiprate 0.15

✅

The `tiprate` command does not work if the `lock` command has been called.

> $lock

✅

> $tiprate 0.15
